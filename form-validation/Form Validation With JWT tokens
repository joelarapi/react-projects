Form Validation with JWT Authentication
This project is a form validation implementation built using React and handling JWT authentication.
It demonstrates how to validate form inputs and securely manage access tokens and refresh tokens for authenticated users.

Features
JWT authentication with access token and refresh token management
Secure communication with a backend API

Installation
To run this application locally, follow these steps:

Clone the repository:
git clone https://github.com/joel-arapi/form-validation.git

Navigate to the project directory:
cd form-validation

Install the required dependencies:
npm install

Start the development server:
npm run dev
The application should now be running at http://localhost:5174.

Usage
Open the application in your web browser.
Fill out the form with the required information.
If there are any validation errors, the form will display appropriate error messages.
Once the form is valid, the application will send a request to the backend API for authentication.
Upon successful authentication, the server will respond with an access token and a refresh token.
The application will store the access token and refresh token securely and use them for subsequent API requests.
If the access token expires, the application will automatically use the refresh token to obtain a new access token.
Technologies Used

JavaScript
JWT (JSON Web Tokens)
